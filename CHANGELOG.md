## [v0.0-rebirth] - 2026-01-14

### Complete Rebirth
**Context**: Original Evolution-Content-Factory-3.pdf over-promised automation and used wrong strategy.

### Added
- 00-MISSION.md - Fight Club funnel strategy (no ownership mentions in v0.0)
- 01-VOICE.md - Single voice guidelines (GTI -> Q7 journey)
- 02-SYSTEMS.md - Manual-templated workflow, S drive structure
- BUILD-v0.0.md - Credibility-first phase (Preview/Recap/Throwback only)
- BUILD-v0.1.md - Pundit tracking (content-of-content, neutral reporting)
- BUILD-v0.2.md - Public leaderboards (tribal engagement)
- BACKLOG.md - Future features (v0.3+ ownership reveal)
- STATE.md - Living decisions log
- CHANGELOG.md - This file

### Changed
- **Strategy**: From "original analysis" to "content-of-content" (referee positioning)
- **Personas**: From "GTI + Q7 separate" to "ONE voice maturing over time"
- **Automation**: From "fully automated n8n" to "manual-templated workflow"
- **Timeline**: From "immediate pundit tracking" to "credibility first, then controversial"

### Deprecated
- Deprecated: "The Tape" -> Replaced with "The Flow"
- Deprecated: GTI/Q7 dual personas -> Single voice
- Deprecated: n8n automation (v0.0) -> Manual workflow
- Deprecated: Cloud Collector (Render.com) -> Local/manual for v0.0
- Deprecated: Scout Agent -> Deferred to backlog
- Deprecated: Expert Ledger (Postgres) -> Google Sheets for v0.0
- Deprecated: Telegram Commander -> Manual approval for v0.0
- Deprecated: ElevenLabs voice -> Google TTS for v0.0 (cost/simplicity)

### Removed
- Evolution-Content-Factory-3.pdf references (archived, not deleted)
- Over-promised features that don't exist yet
- "Refined Guru" branding (replaced with direct positioning)

---

## [Pre-Rebirth] - 2026-01-11

### Context
Original documentation (Evolution-Content-Factory-3.pdf) created with incorrect assumptions:
- Assumed fully automated pipeline existed
- Over-engineered for v0.0 reality
- Wrong content strategy (original analysis vs content-of-content)
- Outdated terminology ("The Tape")

This has been completely replaced.
