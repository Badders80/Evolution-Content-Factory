# BUILD v0.2: The Leaderboard (Controversial)

**Status**: Future Phase (After v0.1 Success)  
**Goal**: Public pundit leaderboard with tribal engagement  
**Prerequisite**: 8+ weeks of neutral v0.1 pundit tracking

---

## Entry Criteria

**DO NOT start v0.2 until**:
- [OK] v0.1 completed (8+ weeks of pundit tracking)
- [OK] Goodwill established with pundit audiences
- [OK] Historical data robust (16+ weeks total)
- [OK] Engagement metrics strong
- [OK] Zero major controversies or backlash in v0.1

**If any of these are NO, stay in v0.1.**

## New Content Type: Public Leaderboard

### **Monday: The Pundit Leaderboard**
**Format**: 60-90 seconds, vertical (1080x1920)  
**Frequency**: 1x per week (replaces neutral pundit recap)  
**Structure**:
- Hook (0-10s): "16 weeks of data. Here's who's been most accurate."
- Leaderboard (10-60s): Top 3, Bottom 2, with stats
- Close (60-90s): "The data doesn't lie. See you next week."

**Example**:
> "Over 16 weeks: BGP 68% strike rate, 47 wins from 69 picks. TAB Form 52%, ACC 44%. The leaderboard has spoken."

---

## Why This is Controversial

### **Tribal Audiences Will Defend**
- Every pundit has loyal followers
- Public rankings = perceived attack
- Comments will be LOUD

### **You Must Be Bulletproof**
- Data accuracy: 100% verified
- Methodology: Transparent, published
- Receipts: Screenshots of every prediction
- Tone: Respectful, factual, never mocking

If you're not bulletproof, you become the leaderboard loser.

## Production Workflow

### **Weekly Leaderboard Update** (90 min)

**1. Data Processing** (30 min)
- Pull 16+ weeks of `flow_ledger.csv`
- Calculate:
  - Win rate (%)
  - Total picks
  - Total wins
  - ROI (if $1 bet on every pick)
  - Confidence breakdown (best bets vs mentions)

**2. Visualization** (30 min)
- Generate leaderboard graphic (ComfyUI)
- Top 3 highlighted (gold, silver, bronze)
- Bottom 2 shown (without shaming)
- Stats overlaid (win rate, total picks)

**3. Script & Render** (30 min)
- Script: Factual, respectful, data-driven
- Voice: Google TTS
- Render: FFmpeg with leaderboard graphic
- Post: TikTok/X/Instagram

## Leaderboard Metrics

### **Primary Metric: Win Rate**
- Total wins / Total picks = Win %
- Most intuitive for audience

### **Secondary Metrics**
- **ROI**: Return on investment if $1 bet on every pick
- **Confidence**: How often "best bets" won vs "mentions"
- **Consistency**: Win rate over time (trending up/down?)

### **Display Format**
BGP - 68% (47/69) | ROI: +$23.40

TAB Form - 52% (31/60) | ROI: +$8.20

SENZ - 48% (29/61) | ROI: -$2.10

...

ACC - 44% (19/43) | ROI: -$5.80

## Tone & Voice Guidelines

### **Respectful, Not Mocking**
OK: "BGP leads the leaderboard over 16 weeks."  
NO: "BGP destroys the competition-everyone else sucks!"

### **Factual, Not Judgmental**
OK: "ACC had a 44% strike rate over this period."  
NO: "ACC was terrible-don't listen to them!"

### **Celebrate Top Performers**
OK: "BGP found 47 winners in 69 picks-impressive consistency."  
OK: "TAB Form showed strong ROI with disciplined selections."

### **Acknowledge Difficulty**
OK: "Racing is hard. These numbers show who's been most consistent."  
NO: "If you can't hit 60%, you're not a real analyst."

Why: You're the referee, not a critic. Respect everyone in the game.

## Risk Management

### **If Backlash Occurs**
1. Stay calm: Do NOT get defensive
2. Show receipts: Screenshots of predictions
3. Explain methodology: "Here's how we track..."
4. Offer corrections: "If we got data wrong, we'll fix it"
5. Never engage in arguments: Block trolls if necessary

### **If Pundit Requests Removal**
- Honor immediately
- Remove from future leaderboards
- Public statement: "We respect X's request, they're off the board"

### **If Data Accuracy Questioned**
- Pause leaderboard immediately
- Audit data
- Issue correction if needed
- Never publish inaccurate data

---

## Success Criteria (v0.2)

**After 8 weeks of public leaderboards**:
- [OK] Tribal engagement (comments, shares, debates)?
- [OK] Credibility intact (seen as fair referee)?
- [OK] No major controversies or reputational damage?
- [OK] Audience growth accelerating?

If YES: Continue leaderboards, consider v0.3.  
If NO: Pause, return to v0.1 neutral reporting.

---

## What We're Still NOT Doing

**Deferred to v0.3+**:
- Ownership mentions (Fight Club rule continues)
- Monetization (no subscriptions, no ads)
- Predictions (still referee only)

**Focus**: Data-driven leaderboards, tribal engagement, referee positioning.

---

## The Moment of Truth

**v0.2 is where you prove**:
- Your data is bulletproof
- Your tone is respectful
- Your positioning as referee is credible

If you nail this, you become the authority. Pundits will want ON the leaderboard, not off it.
