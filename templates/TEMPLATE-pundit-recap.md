## Tone Guidelines (CRITICAL)

### OK Do
- Neutral reporting: State facts only
- Celebrate wins: "BGP found the $18 outsider"
- Respect difficulty: "Racing is hard - these are the results"
- Show all data: Don't cherry-pick

### NO Don't
- Judge quality: Never say "terrible week" or "amazing"
- Mock anyone: No sarcasm, no put-downs
- Rank/compare: Not yet (that's v0.2)
- Use emotive language: Stick to numbers
