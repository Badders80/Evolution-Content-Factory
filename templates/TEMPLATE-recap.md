## Voice Guidelines

### OK Do
- Match pre-race data to actual outcome
- Acknowledge when data was wrong
- Show pattern (flow -> result)

### NO Don't
- Cherry-pick only wins
- Claim you "called it"
- Use hindsight bias ("I knew it all along")

---

## Honesty Framework

**When you were right**:
> "Heavy flow indicated Horse X. Result confirmed: 1st at $8.40."

**When you were wrong**:
> "Contrarian flow suggested Horse Y. Result: unplaced. The data missed this time."

**When flow lacked conviction**:
> "Light flow on Horse Z (8.0 -> 7.5). Narrow win suggests read was correct but volume lacked confidence."
