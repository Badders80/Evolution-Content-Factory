# Voice & Vocabulary

**Version**: v0.0 (Single Voice Edition)  
**Last Updated**: January 13, 2026  
**Purpose**: Define the ONE voice that captures GTI and matures to Q7

---

## The Car Analogy

**GTI** (Golf GTI driver):
- Young, sharp, data-hungry
- Loves stats, moneyball approach
- Fast-paced, engaging content
- **Not ready to own yet** (just following)

**Q7** (Audi Q7 driver):
- Mature, sophisticated
- Understands investment + emotion
- **Ready to own** (fractional ownership makes sense)

**Your content voice** = ONE voice that speaks to someone's journey from GTI -> Q7.

You're not building two personas. You're nurturing one person over time.

## Voice Principles

### **1. Data-Driven, Not Opinion-Led**
- Lead with numbers (sectionals, odds, flow data)
- Quote specific metrics ("moved from 5.0 to 3.2")
- Avoid speculation ("I think this horse will win")

**Example**:
> ✅ "Heavy flow moved Horse X from 5.0 to 3.2 over 18 minutes"  
> ❌ "I reckon Horse X is a good bet"

---

### **2. Moneyball, Not Pub Talk**
- Professional language (not lad slang)
- Clinical tone (Bloomberg for racing)
- Intelligent but accessible

**Example**:
> ✅ "Sectional data shows acceleration in final 600m"  
> ❌ "This horse was flying home, mate!"

---

### **3. Referee, Not Tipster**
- Report what happened, don't predict what will
- Track patterns, don't claim certainty
- Show data, let audience decide

**Example**:
> ✅ "The data showed this pattern. The result was X."  
> ❌ "You should back this horse-guaranteed winner!"

---

### **4. Storyteller When Appropriate**
- Throwback content = emotional hooks
- Underdog narratives = connection to horses
- But ALWAYS grounded in facts

**Example**:
> ✅ "They said he was too small. The sectionals proved otherwise."  
> ❌ "This horse has heart-you can just feel it!"

## Approved Vocabulary

### Core Market Terms

| ✅ Use This | ❌ NOT This | Why |
|-------------|-------------|-----|
| "The Flow" | ~~"The Tape"~~ | Modern institutional term, not outdated 1980s slang |
| "Heavy flow" | ~~"Smart money"~~ | We observe volume, don't claim to know intent |
| "Sectional rank" | ~~"He looks good"~~ | Measurable vs opinion |
| "Market pressure" | ~~"Everyone's on it"~~ | Data vs hype |
| "Directional flow" | ~~"Locked in"~~ | Observable vs certainty |
| "Market participant" | ~~"Punter"~~ | Professional vs casual gambling |

---

### Flow Types (Observable)

**Size-Based**:
- Heavy flow (large volume)
- Concentrated flow (focused on specific runner)
- Light flow (minimal volume)

**Impact-Based**:
- Market-moving flow (caused price change)
- Directional flow (clear one-way pressure)
- Aggressive flow (taking liquidity quickly)

**Pattern-Based**:
- Early flow (60+ minutes before jump)
- Late flow (0-15 minutes before jump)
- Contrarian flow (against public sentiment)

---

## Banned Terminology

**NEVER use**:
- ❌ "Get on it" / "Jump on"
- ❌ "The boys" / "Lad" / "Mate"
- ❌ "Lock" / "Sure thing" / "Can't lose"
- ❌ "Tips" / "Picks" (use "intelligence" / "data")
- ❌ Certainty language ("This WILL win")
- ❌ "Punt" (use "position" or "market allocation")
- ❌ "The Tape" (use "The Flow")

---

## The Three-Part Flow Narrative

Every flow analysis follows this structure:

OBSERVATION (what happened)
"There was [flow type]..."

IMPACT (market response)
"...and it moved the market from [X] to [Y]..."

OUTCOME (result validation)
"...as the result was [outcome]."

### Examples

**When flow was correct**:
> "There was heavy early flow on Horse X, moving the market from 5.0 to 3.2, as the result was a comfortable win."

**When flow was wrong**:
> "There was concentrated late flow on Horse Y, moving the market from 7.0 to 4.5, as the result was unplaced."

**When flow lacked conviction**:
> "There was contrarian flow on Horse Z with minimal impact (8.0 -> 7.5), as the result was a narrow win-the flow read was correct but lacked volume."

---

## Content Type Voice Variations

### **Preview** (Thu/Fri)
**Tone**: Sharp, data-forward, engaging  
**Hook**: "Five horses. One race. Here's what the data says."  
**Focus**: Observable patterns, sectionals, track conditions  
**Close**: Data-driven wrap-up, NO prediction

**Example**:
> "Ellerslie R7. Horse A shows sectional efficiency 12% above field average. Track suits on-pace runners. The numbers don't lie."

---

### **Recap** (Mon)
**Tone**: Clinical, audit-focused, factual  
**Hook**: "[Horse] paid $12.50. Here's what the sectionals showed."  
**Focus**: Match data to outcome, pattern validation  
**Close**: "The data told the story."

**Example**:
> "Horse X won at $8.40. Heavy flow moved the market 40% in 15 minutes. Sectionals ranked #1 in final 600m. The flow indicated it."

---

### **Throwback** (Thu)
**Tone**: Emotional, storytelling, inspiring  
**Hook**: "They said he was too small. The data said otherwise."  
**Focus**: Underdog narrative, emotional connection  
**Close**: Inspirational wrap ("Sometimes the best stories...")

**Example**:
> "Written off at $51. But the stride efficiency data showed something the experts missed. Three months later, Group 1 winner."

---

## Caption Style

**Every video caption** should:
1. Start with hook ("Ellerslie R7 | What the data showed")
2. Include 1-2 key stats (sectional rank, flow data)
3. End with hashtags (#NZRacing #DataDriven)
4. **NO call to action** (Fight Club rule-no ownership mentions)

**Example Caption**:
Ellerslie R7 Preview | Jan 18

Heavy flow moved Horse A from 5.0 to 3.2.
Sectional data ranked #1 in final 800m.

## Meta-Intelligence Layer (v0.1+)

After building a flow ledger (12+ weeks), reference historical patterns:

**Template**:
> "[Flow type] has indicated [outcome] in [X%] of instances over [time period]"

**Example**:
> "Concentrated early flow on short-priced favorites has been correct in 68% of instances since we began tracking."

**Critical Disclaimer** (always include):
> "Past performance doesn't guarantee future results."

---

## Voice Guardrails

### ✅ **Always**:
- Cite data sources inline
- Use specific numbers (not "a lot")
- Show, don't tell
- Let audience draw conclusions

### ❌ **Never**:
- Make predictions
- Use lad slang
- Claim certainty
- Tell people how to bet

## Tone Audit

If you write something and it feels like:
- ❌ "Get on this horse, boys!" -> **Wrong. Rewrite.**
- ❌ "This can't lose!" -> **Wrong. Delete.**
- ✅ "The data shows X. The result was Y." -> **Correct.**

**When in doubt**: Would Bloomberg publish this? If no, rewrite.
